# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
Your medical data {anytime, anywhere} 

This project is to develop a dApp that allows (i) one to write and sign one's own medical onto a blockchain (ii) one's medical practioner to send one's data for one to sign to commit to the blockchain.

What pain points does it address?

Our medical records are typically distributed across the various medical institutions we visited and these data exist in "silo".
The process of requesting one's own medical data is costly and time consuming. With this dApp, you will be able to take custody of your own medical records, all in one centralized location. This is especially useful for people with nomadic careers.

How does it address the last mile issue?

Since we are signing our own data to write to our ID on the blockchain, this overcomes the "malicious" intent that blockchain cannot solves and also the motivation to ensure clean data is written to blockchain is present.
